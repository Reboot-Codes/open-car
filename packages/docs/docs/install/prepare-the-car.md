# Prepare the Car

Due to manufacturer differences, and the nature of "modular" concepts like cars, OpenCar does not have a one-size-fits all piece of hardware.

Although, you may be able to create a holder for the required components. Another thing you might have to make custom is connectors for the built-in sensors and other electronic components that are usually fed to the stock computer.

## Remove the Car Computer

:::note

This does not mean that you remove all wires going to the computer from both sides (e.g. computer and sensors). Instead tape them down to the sides of the car's frame or other location. You may also want to tape off the end to prevent dust and other debris from messing with the connection(s).

:::

This will vary from car to car, but it will usually mean following these steps (change as needed):

1. Disconnect and *carefully* remove the battery.
2. Find and the car computer.
3. Remove connectors and secure them to a different part of the car.
4. Remove bolts/clips keeping the car computer from it's bracket.
