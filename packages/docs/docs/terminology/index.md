# Terminology

OpenCar is a relatively new project/concept. Therefore, we had to create new words to describe all of the different parts that make up the OpenCar system (or operating system).

The core components are:

- OpenFirmware
- OpenUI
- OpenDiagnostics

Each are different concepts entirely. OpenFirmware does actual the controlling of the car's internals. OpenUI provides an in-vehicle user interface. And OpenDiagnostics provides an interface on a separate device (like a phone or tablet) mainly used to diagnose problems.
