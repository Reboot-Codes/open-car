# Introduction

Hi there, thank you for choosing to improve your vehicle!

OpenCar is an (obviously) *Free and Open Source piece of Software* (a.k.a. FOSS) that completely replaces the default computer in your vehicle.

In technical terms, OpenFirmware is a compiled program which interfaces with existing car components to replace and improve on your car's old computer. OpenUI serves as a replacement for your car's infotainment system. OpenDiagnostics is a built-in diagnostics tool instead of having to use an OBD-2 "scanner".

## Disclaimer

OpenCar is licensed under the MIT license, which means that you can use it in just about any way you like. Even for commercial purposes. (This isn't legal advice, check out the license found in the [source repository](https://github.com/Reboot-Codes/open-car/tree/main/LICENSE).)

:::danger

The creators/contributors of OpenCar (again, as stated in the [license](https://github.com/Reboot-Codes/open-car/blob/master/LICENSE)) take no responsibility of any damage to your property.

Do not use any OpenCar interface while driving. (We know that it's designed for that, but you should never take your eyes off the road!)

:::

Also...

- This will *probably* void your car's warranty/insurance. (Check your agreement!)
- Most auto shops won't be able to work on your car. (Unless they know how to work on OpenCar; if they do, cool!)
- You may wreck your vehicle's internals (due to mis-configuration) or otherwise make it unable/unsafe to drive. (Again, again, we are not responsible for any damage or injury.)
