# Introduction

Hi there, thank you for choosing to improve your vehicle!

OpenCar is an (obviously) *Free and Open Source piece of Software* (a.k.a. FOSS) that completely replaces the default computer in your vehicle.

OpenCar is licensed under the MIT license, which means that you can use it in just about any way you like. Even for commercial purposes. (This isn't legal advice, check out the license found in the [source repository](https://github.com/Reboot-Codes/open-car/tree/main/LICENSE).)
